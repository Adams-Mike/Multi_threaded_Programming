# Multi_threaded_Programming
CS246 - File, network, and database operations can be very resource expensive,
so you should not perform these kinds of operations on a main GUI thread. 
So, for this assignment, you will use multithreaded programming to be able to run these more complex, 
time consuming tasks on a background thread, without hanging the GUI.
